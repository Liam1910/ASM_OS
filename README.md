# Custom-Testing-OS
An OS where i test some stuff... You can feel free to download and change it... Please tell me afterwards what you did and how it went (You can also send me a github repo of that)

Have Fun!

PS: If you want to run all of it you have to change the Path in the makefiles (main/Makefile:28,29,37,38  safeMode/Makefile:28,33  testMode/Makefile:28,33) Those lines will be marked with a ** at the start and end of the path...
